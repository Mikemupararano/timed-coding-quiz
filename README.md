# timed-coding-quiz
In this respository, I showcase a timed coding quiz that I designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design a quiz that has questions that are timed. Participants are penalised for getting an answer wrong or not using their time to answer the questions. 
The project is located at the following link:
